If you want to test this with iOS 7.1+ apps, you need to front the rails server with an ssl proxy.

Here's a sample nginx server config section

    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        server_name localhost; 

        #path to your certificate
        ssl_certificate /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt; 
        # path to your ssl key
        ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/etc/nginx/ssl/server.key; 

        # put the rest of your server configuration here.

        root         /dev/null;

        location / {
            # set X-FORWARDED_PROTO so ssl_requirement plugin works
            proxy_set_header X-FORWARDED_PROTO https;
            proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header  Host             $http_host;
            proxy_redirect    off;
            proxy_pass        http://localhost:3000;
        }
    }
